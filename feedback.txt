Classes should be in separate files
Missing javadocs
Remember to use the names outlined in the instructions (value instead of number for Card)
value should not be part of the toString for the card.
Missing equals() method for card.
Do not alter the value given to you when storing it (removing null values from deck).  Null values did not need to be dealt with until option 3
Creating a new deck will go out of bounds (use multiple looks to set the name and suit)
shuffle is not random
reshuffle did not add cards.
print should not exist.
Great attempt!
